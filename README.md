## üéã KRA Automation login attempt. feat/KRA-simple-login
This was an example attempt to see if I could login "as a human" with browser automation tools.

This **IS NOT AN ATTEMPT** to brute force into the itax portal! BrowserBase provides anti-bot mechanisms and I was attempting to micmic human behaviour.

The goal at some point was to allow logging in and viewing payments done.
Why?
I have worked remotely and I've paid taxes before and I was attempting to automate the logging in and consulting payments.
And probably in future allow tax professionals to run scripts automatically.

Used
- Google Vision API and Sharp to help solve the capture.
- BrowserBase basic auto capture tools didnt work for me ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
