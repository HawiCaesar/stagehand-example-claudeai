## KRA login attempt. 
This was an example attempt to see if I could login "as a human" with browser automation tools.

This IS NOT AN ATTEMPT to brute force into the itax portal! BrowserBase provides anti-bot mechanisms and I was attempting to micmic human behaviour.

The goal at some point was to allow logging in and viewing payments my done.
Why?
I have worked remotely and I've paid taxes before and I was attempting to automate that section.
And probably in future allow tax professionals to run scripts automatically.

Used
- Google Vision API and Sharp to help solve the capture. 
- BrowserBase basic auto capture tools didnt work for me ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
